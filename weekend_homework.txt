#Homework

This weekend's homework is to continue working on your card dealing code

Use your existing code to simulate a game of "Pontoon".

## MVP 

- Deal two cards to the dealer and the player
- Compare the hands
- Determine the winner from who has the highest value hand 

## Extension

- Allow the player to "twist" up to 21 or "stick" (you go bust if you exceed this and lose the round).
- Allow the dealer to do the same
- Compare hands once both players have stuck
